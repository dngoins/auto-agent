Feature: AI-Powered Teams Auto-Attendant Call Routing
  As an organization using Microsoft Teams telephony
  I want an automated agent to answer incoming calls and route them via keypad selection
  So that callers can quickly reach Dwight, Janet, or an operator without manual intervention

  Background:
    Given an active Azure subscription exists
    And an Azure Communication Services resource is provisioned
    And an ACS phone number is configured and active
    And Microsoft Teams phone numbers are assigned to Dwight, Janet, and the operator
    And the OpenAI SDK is configured for AI voice generation
    And pre-recorded audio files are available as fallback
    And logging is configured in Azure Monitor or Application Insights

Scenario: Automatically answer incoming call
  Given a caller dials the ACS phone number
  When the call is received by the system
  Then the call should be automatically answered within 3 seconds
  And the caller should hear a greeting message

Scenario: Prompt caller with routing options including operator
  Given the call has been answered
  When the greeting message finishes playing
  Then the system should say "Thank you for calling. Press 1 for Dwight. Press 2 for Janet. Press 0 for operator."
  And the system should listen for DTMF input

Scenario: Route call to Dwight when option 1 is selected
  Given the caller has heard the menu options
  When the caller presses 1
  Then the system should transfer the call to Dwight's Teams phone number
  And the caller should hear a transfer notification
  And the routing action should be logged with timestamp and caller ID

Scenario: Route call to Janet when option 2 is selected
  Given the caller has heard the menu options
  When the caller presses 2
  Then the system should transfer the call to Janet's Teams phone number
  And the caller should hear a transfer notification
  And the routing action should be logged with timestamp and caller ID

Scenario: Route call to operator when option 0 is selected
  Given the caller has heard the menu options
  When the caller presses 0
  Then the system should transfer the call to the operator's Teams phone number
  And the caller should hear a transfer notification
  And the routing action should be logged with timestamp and caller ID

Scenario: Handle invalid keypad input
  Given the caller has heard the menu options
  When the caller presses a key other than 0, 1, or 2
  Then the system should say "Sorry, that is not a valid option. Press 1 for Dwight, 2 for Janet, or 0 for operator."
  And the caller should be allowed up to 3 retry attempts
  And if no valid input is received after 3 attempts
  Then the call should be disconnected politely

Scenario: Handle no input timeout
  Given the caller has heard the menu options
  When no input is received within 5 seconds
  Then the system should repeat the menu prompt
  And the caller should be allowed up to 3 attempts
  And if no valid input is received after 3 attempts
  Then the call should be disconnected politely

Scenario: Send to voicemail when transfer target is busy
  Given the caller has selected a valid routing option
  When the transfer target (Dwight, Janet, or operator) is busy
  Then the system should route the call to the target's voicemail
  And the action should be logged with timestamp and caller ID

Scenario: Send to voicemail when transfer target is unavailable
  Given the caller has selected a valid routing option
  When the transfer target (Dwight, Janet, or operator) is unavailable or does not answer
  Then the system should route the call to the target's voicemail
  And the action should be logged with timestamp and caller ID

Scenario: Use AI-generated voice for prompts
  Given OpenAI SDK is available and configured
  When the system generates greeting or menu prompts
  Then the speech should be dynamically generated using OpenAI text-to-speech API
  And speech latency should not exceed 2 seconds
  And the voice should sound clear and natural

Scenario: Fallback to pre-recorded audio when AI voice generation fails
  Given the OpenAI SDK is unavailable or fails to generate speech
  When the system needs to play a prompt
  Then the system should use pre-recorded audio files as fallback
  And the call flow should continue without interruption
  And the failure should be logged for monitoring

Scenario: Log call activity for observability
  Given any call interaction occurs
  When a call is answered, routed, or terminated
  Then the system should log the timestamp
  And the system should log caller ID if available
  And the system should log selected menu option
  And the system should log transfer destination
  And the system should log call duration
  And the system should log any errors or fallback events

Scenario: Support up to 5 concurrent calls
  Given multiple callers dial simultaneously
  When up to 5 concurrent calls are active
  Then the system should answer and process each call independently
  And routing latency should not exceed 5 seconds per call
  And each call should maintain its own state

Scenario: Reject calls beyond concurrent limit with busy signal
  Given 5 concurrent calls are already active
  When a 6th caller dials the ACS phone number
  Then the system should return a busy signal
  And the call should be rejected
  And the rejection should be logged with timestamp

Scenario: Ensure secure communications
  Given a call is processed by the system
  When signaling and media are transmitted
  Then all communications should be encrypted using TLS
  And access to logs and configuration should require authenticated access
  And caller data should be protected according to security best practices
