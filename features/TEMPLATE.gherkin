# Feature Requirements Template
#
# Fill in this template with your feature idea. You can:
# 1. Use this template and push to GitHub (triggers automatically)
# 2. Copy to a new .gherkin file in features/ directory
# 3. Create a GitHub issue and paste the content (add 'auto-implement' label)
# 4. Use with CLI: python feature_controller.py --requirements-file features/TEMPLATE.gherkin
#
# Tips:
# - Be specific about user actions and expected outcomes
# - Include edge cases and error scenarios
# - One feature per file works best
# - Multiple scenarios are encouraged
# - Use "Given/When/Then" format for clarity

Feature: [Feature Name - Short, descriptive title]
  As a [type of user]
  I want to [goal/desire]
  So that [benefit/value]

  # Background (optional): Common setup for all scenarios
  Background:
    Given [common precondition that applies to all scenarios]
    And [another common precondition]

  # Scenario 1: Happy path - the main success scenario
  Scenario: [Descriptive scenario name - what succeeds]
    Given [precondition - the starting state]
    And [another precondition if needed]
    When [action - what the user does]
    And [another action if needed]
    Then [expected outcome - what should happen]
    And [another expected outcome]

  # Scenario 2: Alternative path or edge case
  Scenario: [Another scenario - edge case or alternative]
    Given [different starting state]
    When [different action]
    Then [different expected outcome]

  # Scenario 3: Error case - what happens when things go wrong
  Scenario: [Error scenario - what fails gracefully]
    Given [precondition that leads to error]
    When [action that triggers error]
    Then [error handling - how system responds]
    And [user feedback - what user sees]

  # Add more scenarios as needed to cover:
  # - Different user types
  # - Edge cases
  # - Error conditions
  # - Security considerations
  # - Performance requirements

# EXAMPLE: Filled-in template
# ==============================================================================

# Feature: User Authentication
#   As a user
#   I want to log in securely with my email and password
#   So that I can access my personalized dashboard
#
#   Background:
#     Given the application is running
#     And the database is accessible
#
#   Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
#     Given a user exists with email "user@example.com" and password "SecurePass123"
#     And the user is not currently logged in
#     When the user enters email "user@example.com"
#     And the user enters password "SecurePass123"
#     And the user clicks the "Log In" button
#     Then the user should be redirected to "/dashboard"
#     And the user should see a welcome message "Welcome back!"
#     And a session token should be created
#
#   Scenario: Failed login with incorrect password
#     Given a user exists with email "user@example.com"
#     When the user enters email "user@example.com"
#     And the user enters password "WrongPassword"
#     And the user clicks the "Log In" button
#     Then the user should remain on the login page
#     And an error message should display "Invalid email or password"
#     And no session token should be created
#
#   Scenario: Failed login with non-existent email
#     Given no user exists with email "nobody@example.com"
#     When the user enters email "nobody@example.com"
#     And the user enters password "AnyPassword"
#     And the user clicks the "Log In" button
#     Then the user should remain on the login page
#     And an error message should display "Invalid email or password"
#     And the error should not reveal whether the email exists
#
#   Scenario: Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
#     Given a user exists with email "user@example.com"
#     And the user has failed to log in 4 times in the last 10 minutes
#     When the user enters email "user@example.com"
#     And the user enters password "WrongPassword"
#     And the user clicks the "Log In" button
#     Then the user should see an error "Account temporarily locked. Try again in 15 minutes."
#     And the account should be locked for 15 minutes
#     And a notification email should be sent to "user@example.com"

# QUICK REFERENCE: Gherkin Keywords
# ==============================================================================
#
# Feature: High-level description of a software feature
# Background: Common steps that run before each scenario
# Scenario: Specific example/test case
# Given: Preconditions (initial context/state)
# When: Action/event that triggers behavior
# Then: Expected outcome/result
# And: Additional step (same type as previous)
# But: Negative assertion (alternative to And)
# Scenario Outline: Template for multiple scenarios with examples
# Examples: Data table for Scenario Outline
#
# ==============================================================================
# BEST PRACTICES
# ==============================================================================
#
# ✓ DO:
# - Write from the user's perspective
# - Be specific and concrete
# - Include positive and negative scenarios
# - Focus on behavior, not implementation
# - Use present tense
# - One action per When step when possible
#
# ✗ DON'T:
# - Use technical jargon unnecessarily
# - Describe UI implementation details
# - Make scenarios too long (split into multiple)
# - Assume knowledge - be explicit
# - Write vague expectations
